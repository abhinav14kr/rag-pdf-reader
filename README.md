Got it — here’s the entire `README.md` in one copy-paste block:

# Dostoevsky RAG Web App

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that lets users ask questions about Dostoevsky's books directly in their browser. It uses:

- **pypdf** to parse PDF books into text
- **Transformers.js** for local embeddings (MiniLM)
- **WebLLM** for running an open-source language model in the browser with WebGPU
- **GitHub Pages** for free deployment

All models run client-side, so the app can be hosted entirely for free without a backend server.

## Preprocessing (Building the Index)

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd preprocess
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate    # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your Dostoevsky PDF books in `../data/`.

4. Run the preprocessor:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

This will generate `web/public/index.json` containing embeddings and metadata for retrieval.

## Local Development

You can serve the `web/` folder locally:

### Option 1: With Node.js

```bash
cd web
npx serve .
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

### Option 2: With Python

```bash
cd web
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically builds and publishes the `web/` folder to GitHub Pages.

Steps:

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update site"
   git push
   ```
2. Go to your repo → **Settings → Pages** and ensure **Source = GitHub Actions**.
3. Wait for the workflow to finish under the **Actions** tab.
4. Your site will be available at:

   ```
   https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/rag-dostoevsky/
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the deployed site.
2. Wait for the models to load (first run may take 1–2 minutes).
3. Type a question such as:

   ```
   Who is Raskolnikov?
   ```
4. The app will retrieve relevant passages from the PDFs and generate an answer, citing the sources.

---

## Notes

* First load may be slow because the browser must download model weights (~hundreds of MB).
* WebGPU is recommended for better performance. Enable it in Chrome/Edge if not already active (`chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`).
* All inference happens in the browser — no server costs.

---

## License

This project is for educational purposes. The texts of Dostoevsky's works are in the public domain.

```

Do you want me to also add a **Troubleshooting** section (for issues like NDArray disposal or model not loading) at the bottom so future users won’t get stuck?
